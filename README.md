Industrial LED Testing Machine Firmware

Firmware developed for an industrial LED testing device, implemented on ESP32 and Nuvoton N76E003 microcontrollers.
The system controls motor movement, sensor feedback, manual overrides, safety limits and error handling to automate repetitive hardware testing cycles. The project focuses on reliable state management, fault detection, and safe operation under practical constraints.
This repository contains the core firmware logic used in production, including motor control, sensor handling, timing logic, and reset/recovery behaviour.
